#RescueTime Systray Graph

This makes a graph of your RescueTime productivity and shows it on your sys tray.

Green bars means that the productivity is > 50 and Red means < 50. Bigger reds are bad and bigger greens are good!

Tested only for Mac OSX 10.7 Lion!

You need a file key.cfg
    [rescuetime]
    apikey = key_goes_here_without_quotes
